  Welcome to<br/>Pies per Mile
</h1>

<p>
  <span class='crazy'>Pies per Mile</span> is here to help you become more healthy by increasing
  the amount of exercise you take and making healthier food choices. It has a
  number of handy tools that will:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Help you <a href="#/route">choose a mode of transport</a> that integrates
    appropriate exercise into your daily routine.
  </li>
  <li>
    Suggest recreational routes in your local area that you can explore.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide healthy and nutritious meal suggestions.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  One of the most successful ways to improve health is calorie counting, as
  keeping food intake in balance with energy expended is the fundamental goal
  of a healthy lifestyle. Let's face it though, we all find it difficult to
  picture a calorie. It can feel like a Wednesday afternoon maths lesson trying
  to keep on top of it all.

  right for your lifestyle.
