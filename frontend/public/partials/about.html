<h1>About page</h1>

<p>This is the Pies per mile application, which aims to help people
  link food to exercise in a fun way
</p>

<p>The core of the app is a route choice app, which gives people a
  range of choices for transport options
</p>

<p>
  Journeys are rated in distance and 'number of pies', taking a
  universal standard pie of 230 kcal.
