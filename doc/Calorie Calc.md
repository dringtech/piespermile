Walking Calorie Burn Equations

For -5% grade:
CB = [0.0251 x KPH3 - 0.2157 x KPH2 + 0.7888 x KPH + 1.2957] x WKG x T
For -4% grade:
CB = [0.0244 x KPH3 - 0.2079 x KPH2 + 0.8053 x KPH + 1.3281] x WKG x T
For -3% grade:
CB = [0.0237 x KPH3 - 0.2000 x KPH2 + 0.8217 x KPH + 1.3605] x WKG x T
For -2% grade:
CB = [0.0230 x KPH3 - 0.1922 x KPH2 + 0.8382 x KPH + 1.3929] x WKG x T
For -1% grade:
CB = [0.0222 x KPH3 - 0.1844 x KPH2 + 0.8546 x KPH + 1.4253] x WKG x T
For 0% grade:
CB = [0.0215 x KPH3 - 0.1765 x KPH2 + 0.8710 x KPH + 1.4577] x WKG x T
For +1% grade:
CB = [0.0171 x KPH3 - 0.1062 x KPH2 + 0.6080 x KPH + 1.8600] x WKG x T
For +2% grade:
CB = [0.0184 x KPH3 - 0.1134 x KPH2 + 0.6566 x KPH + 1.9200] x WKG x T
For +3% grade:
CB = [0.0196 x KPH3 - 0.1205 x KPH2 + 0.7053 x KPH + 1.9800] x WKG x T
For +4% grade:
CB = [0.0208 x KPH3 - 0.1277 x KPH2 + 0.7539 x KPH + 2.0400] x WKG x T
For +5% grade:
CB = [0.0221 x KPH3 - 0.1349 x KPH2 + 0.8025 x KPH + 2.1000] x WKG x T
where

CB = Calorie burn (in calories)
KPH = Walking speed (in kilometres per hour)
WKG = Weight (in kilograms)
T = Time (in hours)

For +6% to 15% grade:
CB = [0.1 x MPM + 1.8 x MPM x FG + 3.5] x WKG x T x 60 x 5 / 1000
where

CB = Calorie burn (in calories)
MPM = Walking speed (in meters per minute)
FG = Walking surface grade (expressed as a fraction, i.e. 6% = .06)
WKG = Weight (in kilograms)
T = Time (in hours)
The units for the constant 3.5 are milliliters of oxygen per kilogram per minute.
The units for the constant 60 are minutes per hour.
The units for the constant 5 are calories per liter of oxygen
The units for the constant 1000 are milliliters of oxygen per liter of oxygen.
